## Game rules
### Dealer button
The dealer button represents the dealer and is held by a player. It affects the blinds and the first player to take action in a betting round. The dealer button moves one position to the left of the current dealer after every hand cycle.

### Blinds
Blinds have to be paid before hole cards are dealt.
- Small blind: imidiate left to the dealer button
- Big blind: Player left to the small blind
- New players joining the table: either have to wait for being big blind or pay
big blind on their first hand cycle.

### Player actions
The first to act in a betting round is the player left to the big blind.
A betting round ends when everyone acted at least once and they
bet equially, went all in or fold.
Players have to wait for their turns.
#### Actions
- **Check**: A player can check if they are the first to act or players acting before checked.
- **Fold**: A player can fold without conditions
- **Bet**: A player can bet if they are the first to act or players acting before checked.
- **Raise**: A player can raise if some one acting before placed a bet.

### Betting
- **No limit**: Players can bet any amount equal to or greater than the big blind, up to their entire stack. Raises have to be at least double the last raise. The limit of four raises.
For example, in a $1/2 no limit game with a limit of four raises per round, the first player to act could bet any amount from big blind to entire chips. If the first player bet $20 the second player could raise up toa minimum of $42.
If the second player re-raise $42 the third player could raise up to $82.
- **Fixed limit**: The bet amount and raise amount are predetermined. Limit for pre flop and flop is equal to the small blind, for turn and river the limit is equal to the big blind.
Players can raise up to 4 times each betting round. Each successive raise can be double the amount of the previous one.
For example, in a $1/2 fixed limit game with a limit of three raises per round, the first player to act could bet $1,
the second player could raise to $2, the third player could re-raise to $3, and the fourth player could cap the betting by raising to $4.
After the fourth raise, players would only be able to call or fold.
- **Pot limit**: In pot limit games, the maximum bet or raise allowed in each round of betting is equal to the size of the pot.
For example, in the $1/$2 game the player could raise anything from $2 up to $5 (the pot being the two blinds [$1 + $2], plus the theoretical "call" player would have made of the big blind [$2]: $2 + $2 + $1 = $5). Additional raises are handled similarly.
There is a minimum limit of the big blind and can be raised up to 4 times.

### Winning the pot
When a player goes all-in and is called by one or more opponents, a main pot and one or more side pots may be created.
The main pot consists of all the chips that were in play before any player went all-in, while the side pot(s) consist
of any additional chips bet by the remaining players that the all-in player is not eligible to win.

The all-in player can only win the main pot and any side pot up to the amount of their all-in bet.
The remaining players will continue to compete for any remaining side pots. If multiple players go all-in, multiple side pots may be created.

At showdown, the best five-card poker hand using any combination of hole cards and community cards wins the main pot,
and any remaining side pots are awarded to the player with the best hand among the remaining players who are eligible to win that pot.
If there is a tie for the best hand, the pot(s) will be split evenly among the tied players. If all but one player folds, the remaining player wins the pot without having to reveal their cards.
